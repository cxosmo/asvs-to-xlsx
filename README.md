A script to parse the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) JSON format to xlsx. Optional flag available (`-c`) for appending custom columns. The expected use case is to support generating checklist-type spreadsheets from the ASVS.

*Tested on [ASVS 4.0.3](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/docs_en/OWASP%20Application%20Security%20Verification%20Standard%204.0.3-en.json) - standard (non-flat) version only. Script may require updating if the ASVS JSON schema changes!*
